# Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction-using-TF-Keras

This projects aims on creating and training Neural Networks, capable of predicting responses of customers when a vehicle insurance is suggested. Using an unbalanced dataset where most of the answers are negatives, an effort is being made to optimize the model's perfomance using techniques such as Resampling and Cost-Sensitive Neural Networks.
